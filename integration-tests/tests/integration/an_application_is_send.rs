//! An application crosses threads: it is spawned as an ordinary task, and its DI root
//! resolves from a worker that did not build it.
//!
//! Neither is a claim about throughput. No bound on the serve path changed, and how many
//! requests run at once is the runtime's business. What was blocked was composition: an
//! application had to be the outermost future or sit inside a `LocalSet`, so a server and a
//! client shared a process only with scaffolding, and a job could not resolve a provider off
//! the thread that built the container.
//!
//! Every test here runs on a multi-thread runtime and spawns with `tokio::spawn`. A
//! `LocalSet` anywhere in this file would defeat its purpose.
