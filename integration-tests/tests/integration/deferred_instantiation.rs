//! A dependency that is not built yet is waited for; one that does not exist is refused.
//!
//! Providers are instantiated module by module, and a global provider becomes available only once
//! the module contributing it has been built. A module ordered before that one asks for something
//! that exists and is not ready, which is a wait rather than a failure: the loader sets it aside
//! and comes back on a later pass. Nothing about the wait is visible from outside — a retry that
//! stopped happening would surface as an application that refuses to start, naming a provider the
//! reader can see is declared.
