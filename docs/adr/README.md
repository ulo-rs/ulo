# Architecture Decision Records

Records of architectural decisions with lasting consequences and non-obvious rationale — the *why*
behind choices that a reader of the code alone would have to reverse-engineer or, worse, would
unknowingly undo.

An ADR is warranted when a decision (a) shapes how a whole class of features is built, (b) rests on a
constraint or trade-off that isn't visible from the resulting code, or (c) records a road deliberately
*not* taken. Routine implementation choices don't need one; `git log` and code comments cover those.

## Format

Lightweight [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/): context → decision → consequences. Numbered,
append-only. A superseded ADR stays in place with its status changed and a pointer to the successor —
the history is part of the value.
