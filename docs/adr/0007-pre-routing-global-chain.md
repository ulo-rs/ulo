# 0007 — The global middleware chain anchors before routing, per adapter, pinned by a conformance suite

Status: accepted

## Context

The global chain's documentation promised "runs before the adapter's routing on every request."
The implementations did not deliver that: all five HTTP adapters invoked `AdapterContext::execute`
*inside* each matched route's handler, plus once more in a path fallback for 404s. That anchor point
misses an entire request class — a known path with an unregistered method. The native router (axum's
`MethodRouter`, and each framework's equivalent) answers 405 before any ulo code runs.

The gap is not cosmetic. CORS preflight is exactly the 405 shape: browsers send `OPTIONS /users` to a
route that only registers `GET`, so a `CorsMiddleware` on the global chain would never see the one
request it exists to answer. Request mutation had the same ceiling — rewriting the path inside a
matched handler is too late to change which route runs, so "pre-routing" middleware semantics
(Express/NestJS `app.use`) were unachievable.

The reference architecture here is NestJS's actual mechanism: Nest owns no router. It registers
routes onto the host framework and anchors global behavior at the host's own outermost point
(Express's middleware stack, Fastify's plugin/hook system). The guarantee is behavioral, realized
natively per adapter — and where the host can't express it, the adapter reaches for a host-native
substitute rather than a shared mechanism.

## Decision

The contract lives in core documentation; the mechanism lives in each adapter; conformance is a
test suite, not a hope.

**Contract** (on `AdapterContext::execute` and `HttpAdapter::into_lifecycle`): the global chain runs
once per inbound request, before route resolution. It observes every request — matched, unknown
path, method mismatch, WebSocket upgrade. It may short-circuit with a response. The request it
forwards is the one the router matches on.

**Conformance suite** (`integration-tests/tests/integration/global_chain_conformance.rs`): six
behaviors every HTTP adapter must exhibit — chain on matched route, on 404, on 405, middleware
answering preflight, short-circuit before the handler, and a path rewrite that changes the matched
route. The 405, preflight, and rewrite cases are the discriminators a post-routing anchor cannot
pass.

**Axum realization**: a `GlobalChainService` wraps the finished `Router` as a `tower::Service`; the
routing closure handed to `ctx.execute` is the entire router, not one handler. Both conversion
directions are re-wraps, not copies:

- *Requests*: `HttpRequest` wraps `http::Request<RequestBody>`, so native → ulo → native preserves
  extensions (path params, hyper's upgrade slot) and body streaming.
- *Responses*: whatever the router produces — a ulo handler's response, a native 405, a WebSocket
  handshake reply — is re-wrapped into `HttpResponse` for the chain to observe, body included.
  This rests on the Send-only response body model: `BoxBody` is `UnsyncBoxBody`, so axum's `!Sync`
  native body fits without buffering and streaming responses (SSE) flow through untouched.
  Response extensions do not survive the re-wrap; nothing relies on them (hyper drives WebSocket
  upgrades from the request side).

**Poem realization**: a `GlobalChainEndpoint` wraps the finished `Route` (itself an `Endpoint`).
One divergence from axum: poem's WebSocket upgrade slot lives in the `Request`'s internal state,
not in http extensions, so the original request shell moves into the routing closure and the
chain's output (method, URI, headers, extensions, body) is written back onto it before
routing — rebuilding the request would drop the upgrade. Router errors (`MethodNotAllowedError`
et al.) convert via `into_response()`, which is how 405s reach the chain.

**Salvo realization**: salvo has no substitutable service type — `Server::serve` takes the
concrete `salvo::Service` — so the chain anchors as the goal of a catch-all router and drives an
inner `Service` through salvo's public `hyper_handler` entry, with the request shell moved into
the routing closure the same way as poem's. Two host constraints shape the rest: `ReqBody::Boxed`'s inner type is
crate-private, so the chain's request body rides to the route handlers in a request extension
rather than being reconstituted into the salvo request; and salvo's router cannot distinguish a
method mismatch from an unmatched path (method and path are both opaque filters), so the fallback
consults the route table and answers 405 with an `Allow` header itself.

**Actix realization**: an App-level `Transform` middleware — routing happens inside the wrapped
service, so the middleware position is genuinely pre-routing. The distinctive constraint is `Send`:
the chain requires a `Send` routing closure, but actix's inner service is worker-local (`!Send`,
`Rc`-based). A oneshot channel bridge closes the gap — the routing closure sends the request to,
and awaits the response from, a worker-local dispatch future joined alongside the chain in the same
task. Mutations write back through `head_mut` plus a `match_info` refresh (the `NormalizePath`
precedent), which requires that no clone of the request exist during dispatch — actix's router
mutates `match_info` through `Rc::get_mut` while matching. The fallback carries the same
route-table 405 logic as salvo, since actix also falls through to `default_service` on method
mismatch.

**Rocket realization**: the internal-matching case. Fairings cannot short-circuit with a response,
so rocket offers no pre-routing anchor at all; instead one catch-all route per method hosts the
chain and routing is internal (`match_route` over the ulo route table, including param capture and
the 405/`Allow` logic). Rocket's router reduces to connection serving. WebSocket upgrades need the
borrowed rocket request, which the `'static` routing closure cannot hold — the closure returns a
marker response for WS paths, and the outer handler performs the upgrade only if the marker
survived the chain, so middleware can reject upgrades by replacing the response.

## Considered and rejected

**A ulo-owned router (`matchit`) in the serve path.** It would make the five native routers dumb
byte-pumps and re-implement path matching the hosts already do well. Nest never does this; the
adapter contract doesn't need it. `matchit` remains a legitimate private mechanism for an adapter
whose host offers no anchor point (rocket's fairings cannot short-circuit), and for a future
adapter-independent portless handler — both out of scope here.

## Consequences

- CORS, rate limiting, and auth on the global chain are now actually global on axum: 404s, 405s,
  and preflight all traverse the chain. A core `CorsMiddleware` becomes buildable.
- Middleware can rewrite the request pre-routing and change which route runs — Express/Nest
  `app.use` semantics.
- Same-port WebSocket handshake requests now traverse the chain (they bypassed it before). This is
  intended: the handshake is an HTTP request, and middleware can now reject upgrades.
- Conformance status: **all five adapters pass** — axum, poem, salvo, actix, rocket.
- The composed value — chain wrapped around router — is one `tower::Service`. Binding the socket is
  the only step after composition, which is the natural seam for portless dispatch (in-process
  testing, serverless) if that lands later.
- Per-request overhead on axum: one extra re-wrap in each direction — no copying, no buffering.
