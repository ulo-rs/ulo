//! Bridge between a `#[injectable]` provider and an optional `#[new]` constructor.
//!
//! The derive generates the provider factory from the struct's fields and cannot see a `#[new]`
//! method on a separate `impl`. Rather than *detect* the constructor, the derive simply *calls* it:
//! the factory invokes `Self::__ulo_ctor_build(deps)` and `Self::__ulo_ctor_tokens()` at a site
//! where the type is concrete. Method resolution does the dispatch — `#[new]` emits inherent
//! associated fns that out-rank the blanket [`CtorBridge`] defaults below, so a type with a
//! constructor returns `Some(..)` (build via the constructor) and any other type returns `None`
//! (fall back to field injection).
//!
//! The factory must call these at a concrete-type site (the generated code names the struct); the
//! inherent-wins resolution is a property of the call site, not available through a generic `T`.
