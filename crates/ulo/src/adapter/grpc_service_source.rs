//! What a gRPC service declares, and how it is registered with tonic.
//!
//! Each service is declared in its module's `controllers:` list and hands its source over as
//! `Dispatch::Grpc`. The framework resolves the declared enhancer tokens against the role registry
//! at create, stores the `(source, enhancers)` pair, and hands it back at bind through
//! [`register_with`](GrpcServiceSource::register_with) so the macro-generated body can wrap itself
//! in an enhancer-aware tonic service.
//!
//! Nothing here reaches an instance. Registration happens before any call exists, so a service
//! built per call has nothing to answer with yet; the source knows the declarations without one and
//! produces instances later, inside the call being served.
//!
//! The `dyn Any` registrar keeps tonic types out of ulo core. The macro emits a body that
//! downcasts to `tonic::service::RoutesBuilder` and calls
//! `add_service(MyServiceServer::new(wrapper))`, where `wrapper` carries the source and the
//! resolved enhancers. Ulo core never names tonic.
