/// Implemented by every HTTP transport adapter (axum, actix, poem, rocket,
/// salvo). The framework calls [`register_route`](Self::register_route) and
/// [`register_ws_route`](Self::register_ws_route) during route resolution to register routes,
/// then calls [`into_lifecycle`](Self::into_lifecycle) once to consume the
/// adapter and produce a self-contained lifecycle handle.
///
/// Lifecycle methods (`listen` + `close`) used to live on this trait. They
/// were stripped: the framework's orchestrator never invoked them directly,
/// and keeping them on the public trait made every adapter crate carry
/// callback plumbing back from the lifecycle handle. The handle now owns
/// its own state and the trait surface is config-only.
///
/// # Bounded in-flight on HTTP
///
/// Notable absence vs. [`RpcAdapter`](crate::adapter::RpcAdapter) and
/// [`GrpcAdapter`](crate::adapter::GrpcAdapter): no `with_max_inflight`.
/// HTTP adapters wrap five different framework crates (axum, actix, poem,
/// rocket, salvo) each with their own middleware model, and the framework
/// already owns a cross-adapter abstraction that solves this without
/// touching the trait surface: the global middleware chain in
/// [`AdapterContext`](crate::adapter::AdapterContext) runs pre-routing on
/// every HTTP adapter.
///
/// Users wanting bounded concurrent in-flight on HTTP can:
///
/// 1. Add a semaphore-backed `Middleware` to the global chain via
///    `app.use_global_middleware(...)` — works uniformly on every HTTP
///    adapter without per-adapter wiring.
/// 2. Reach for the framework-native answer when an adapter exposes it
///    directly: a `tower::limit::GlobalConcurrencyLimitLayer` on axum/poem,
///    actix-web middleware, a Rocket fairing, etc.
/// 3. Place a reverse proxy (nginx, HAProxy) in front and let it handle
///    rate-limiting at the network layer.
///
/// Folding this knob into the trait would mean five framework-specific
/// integrations for one feature that the existing middleware path solves
/// once — out of scope for the adapter trait.

    ///    cannot serve on an existing listener returns an error for the
