/// Distinct from [`RpcAdapter`](crate::adapter::RpcAdapter) by design: gRPC is
/// contract-first (services and methods are declared in `.proto` files and
/// known at compile time via `tonic`-generated traits), supports four call
/// shapes (unary + three streaming modes), and dispatches via typed protobuf
/// messages. None of those fit the pattern-string + JSON-data + unary
/// contract that `RpcAdapter` encodes for TCP/UDP/NATS.
///
/// Adapter implementations register tonic services on the wrapped
/// `tonic::transport::Server` *during their own construction* — before
/// `register_services()` is called by the framework. The framework only
/// orchestrates the shared lifecycle: `register_services` →
/// `into_lifecycle`, then drives the returned handle. Per-request dispatch
/// is entirely inside tonic and the user's trait `impl`s.

/// independently of the Rust one.

/// `#[grpc_methods]` reads this into [`GrpcContext::method`](crate::context::GrpcContext::method),
