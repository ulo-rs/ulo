//! Shared `catch_unwind` wrappers so every pipeline segment gets the same
//! [`PanicRecovered`] event shape on unwind.
//!
//! Each transport's dispatcher wraps user-supplied callbacks — guards,
//! interceptors, error handlers, response renderers — in
//! `AssertUnwindSafe(...).catch_unwind()` and converts the payload into a
//! [`PanicRecovered`] tagged with the matching [`PipelineSegment`]. The
//! event then flows through the error chain rather than escaping the
//! dispatcher and tearing down the request.
//!
//! Two flavours: [`catch_async`] for `Future`-returning callbacks (guards,
//! interceptors, handlers, error handlers) and [`catch_sync`] for the rare
//! synchronous segment (today: rendering a response).
//!
//! `AssertUnwindSafe` is load-bearing — user code isn't required to be
//! `UnwindSafe`, and adding that bound to public traits would propagate
//! deep into application code. The dispatcher is responsible for not
//! reusing borrowed state after a caught unwind, which is the case at
//! every wrap site below since the callback owns its own borrow scope.
