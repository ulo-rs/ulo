//! `ulo::Error` — the framework's error contract.
//!
//! A type implementing `Error` declares its semantic [`kind`](Error::kind);
//! the transport's handler error type ([`HttpError`](crate::http::HttpError),
//! [`RpcError`](crate::rpc::RpcError),
//! [`WsError`](crate::ws::WsError)) carries the wire shape and provides
//! a `From<E: Error>` blanket so a `ulo::Error` returned by a handler flows
//! into the right transport via `?`.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use ulo::{Error, ErrorKind};
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
//! enum BillingError {
//!     #[error("invoice {0} not found")]
//!     InvoiceNotFound(String),
//!     #[error("card declined")]
//!     CardDeclined,
//! }
//!
//! impl Error for BillingError {
//!     fn kind(&self) -> ErrorKind {
//!         match self {
//!             Self::InvoiceNotFound(_) => ErrorKind::NotFound,
//!             Self::CardDeclined       => ErrorKind::UnprocessableEntity,
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The handler returns `Result<T, BillingError>`; the macro converts the
//! `Err` arm to the active transport's error type, and the dispatcher
//! renders the canonical envelope from `kind` / `message` / `details`.
