//! Bridge between a `#[controller]` struct and its `#[patterns]` impl.
//!
//! `#[patterns]` emits `handle_message` on the struct and a `RpcControllerSource` companion
//! carrying the patterns and the enhancer tokens; all three delegate to `Self::__ulo_rpc_*` at the
//! concrete type, through the inherent `__ulo_rpc_*` fns that out-rank the defaults below.
//! RPC has no connection hooks, so all three are derived from the impl scan — `#[patterns]` is
//! pure aggregation.
//!
//! What a controller *declares* — its patterns and its enhancer tokens — takes no receiver, because
//! the framework has to read it at startup to register the controller, and an execution-scoped
//! controller has no instance until a call arrives. Only `handle_message` needs one.
//!
//! Both forms carry the same constraint: the call site must name the concrete type. Reached through
//! a generic, `T::__ulo_rpc_patterns()` resolves to the default below and answers empty rather than
//! failing — see ADR 0001.
