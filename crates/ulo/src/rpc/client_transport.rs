/// - [`send`] — request-response: waits for a reply
/// - [`emit`] — fire-and-forget: returns once the message is dispatched
///
/// Both carry per-call `metadata` — a flat string map the transport places on
/// its native side channel (NATS/AMQP/MQTT headers, or the request envelope for
/// Redis/TCP/UDP) and the server surfaces as `RpcContext` metadata. The map is
/// empty for the plain `RpcClient::send`/`emit` shorthands.
