//! Every diagnostic the macros document, executed.
//!
//! These macros' contract with a user is substantially a set of error
//! messages: what to write instead of `:param`, which two parameters broke the
//! one-body rule, that a handler impl may name one transport. Each is written
//! down in the workspace reference and on the docs site, and none of them was
//! run until this suite. A regression there does not break a build — it
//! replaces a message that says what to do with one that does not, which is
//! the entire value of having written a custom diagnostic.
//!
//! Each case is a file that must fail to compile, beside the `.stderr` it must
//! produce. Regenerate after an intended change:
//!
//! ```text
//! rustup run 1.98.1 -- env TRYBUILD=overwrite \
//!     cargo test -p ulo-macros --test diagnostics
//! ```
//!
//! The version matters. Three of these snapshots carry rustc's own rendering
//! below the macro's text, and rustc rewords its half every few releases, so
//! CI runs this target on a pinned compiler rather than on `stable` — see the
//! `diagnostics` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which holds the version
//! and the reason. Regenerating on a different compiler produces a snapshot
//! that only fails in CI.
//!
//! Writing a case is not enough on its own. trybuild accepts any stable
//! output, so a case that stops reaching its diagnostic and starts failing
//! earlier — a parse error, a missing import — still passes once its snapshot
//! is regenerated. `every_case_reaches_its_diagnostic` pins the words instead,
//! and it is the check that reports a case of that kind. `#[websocket_gateway]`
//! had one: its arg parser left the inline struct unconsumed, so syn reported
//! "unexpected token" and the message naming the new form never ran.
