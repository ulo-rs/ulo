// Tests: `tests/` needs a live Kafka, started by testcontainers, and is
// gated behind the `integration` feature. Without it the files compile to
// nothing and `cargo test -p ulo-rpc-kafka` reports a clean run of none:
//
//     cargo test -p ulo-rpc-kafka --features integration
//
// There is no reconnect suite here; redis, mqtt and rabbitmq each have one.

//! Apache Kafka transport for the Ulo RPC gateway.
//!
//! Kafka is an event log, not a request-response bus, but it carries message
//! headers — so per-call metadata and the reply addressing ride headers (no
//! envelope), and request-response is emulated: a request names a reply topic
//! and a correlation id in its headers, the server publishes the reply there,
//! and the client routes replies back by correlation id.
//!
//! A pattern maps to a Kafka topic. Topics are expected to auto-create on the
//! broker (`auto.create.topics.enable`, the default); otherwise create the
//! request and reply topics out of band.
//!
//! - [`KafkaAdapter`] — server side; a `StreamConsumer` subscribed to the
//!   pattern topics, replying via a `FutureProducer`.
//! - [`KafkaClientTransport`] — client side; a producer plus one consumer on a
//!   private reply topic, correlation-routed.
