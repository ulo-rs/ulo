// Tests: this crate has no `tests/` of its own. Nothing it does is
// observable without an application dispatching through it, so its
// behaviour is proved in `integration-tests`:
// the fourteen `grpc_*` files, plus `rpc_grpc*` for the macro forms.

//! gRPC transport adapter for the [Ulo](https://github.com/ulo-rs/ulo) framework.
//!
//! Drives a [`tonic`](https://docs.rs/tonic) server through Ulo's bind /
//! serve / drain lifecycle. Services declared with the framework's
//! `#[controller]` + `#[grpc_methods]` macros are discovered via DI and
//! wrapped with the enhancer pipeline (guards / interceptors / error
//! handlers + panic recovery) before being handed to tonic — there is no
//! manual `*Server::new(handler)` step in user code.
//!
//! # Minimal example
//!
//! The build script compiles the proto and writes what each method carries
//! beside the trait, which is what lets a handler's parameters be extractors:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // build.rs
//! ulo_build::compile_protos("proto/orders.proto")?;
//! ```
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::net::SocketAddr;
//! use ulo::UloFactory;
//! use ulo::extract::Payload;
//! use ulo_macros::{controller, grpc_methods, module, new};
//!
//! mod orders_pb {
//!     tonic::include_proto!("ulo_examples.orders");
//! }
//!
//! #[controller]
//! pub struct OrdersGrpcService {}
//!
//! #[grpc_methods(orders_pb::orders_server::Orders)]
//! impl OrdersGrpcService {
//!     #[new]
//!     pub fn new() -> Self { Self {} }
//!
//!     #[grpc_method]
//!     async fn create(&self, Payload(req): Payload<orders_pb::CreateOrderRequest>)
//!         -> Result<orders_pb::CreateOrderResponse, OrderError>
//!     { /* … */ }
//! }
//!
//! #[module(controllers: [OrdersGrpcService])]
//! struct AppModule;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let addr: SocketAddr = "127.0.0.1:50051".parse().unwrap();
//!     let mut app = UloFactory::create(AppModule).await.unwrap();
//!     app.use_grpc_adapter(ulo_grpc::GrpcAdapter::new(addr)).unwrap();
//!     app.start().await.unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Mixing DI-registered and manually-added services
//!
//! [`GrpcAdapter::add_service`] accepts any tonic-generated service handle,
//! so a non-DI service can sit alongside the DI-registered ones:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let adapter = ulo_grpc::GrpcAdapter::new(addr)
//!     .add_service(SomeOtherServer::new(other_handler));
//! app.use_grpc_adapter(adapter)?;
//! ```
//!
//! Services added this way do not get the enhancer pipeline — they pass
//! straight through to tonic. Services registered via DI go through guards,
//! interceptors, error handlers, and the panic catcher.
//!
//! # Reflection and health
//!
//! Both are ordinary services, so both arrive through `add_service` rather than
//! through anything this crate owns. Reflection lets `grpcurl` and its kin
//! explore the server without a local `.proto`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // build.rs — write the compiled schema somewhere the binary can read it
//! let descriptor = PathBuf::from(env::var("OUT_DIR")?).join("orders_descriptor.bin");
//! ulo_build::configure()
//!     .tonic(|b| b.file_descriptor_set_path(&descriptor))
//!     .compile_protos(&["proto/orders.proto"], &["proto"])?;
//!
//! // main.rs
//! const DESCRIPTOR: &[u8] = include_bytes!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/orders_descriptor.bin"));
//!
//! let reflection = tonic_reflection::server::Builder::configure()
//!     .register_encoded_file_descriptor_set(DESCRIPTOR)
//!     .build_v1()?;
//! let adapter = ulo_grpc::GrpcAdapter::new(addr).add_service(reflection);
//! ```
//!
//! `grpcurl -plaintext 127.0.0.1:50051 list` then answers with the services
//! the framework registered from `#[grpc_methods]`, since reflection and DI
//! discovery reach the same route set.
//!
//! Register the versions the callers need: newer tooling speaks
//! `grpc.reflection.v1`, older speaks `v1alpha`, and `build_v1alpha()` is the
//! other constructor. Which schemas a server exposes is a policy decision,
//! which is why it is written out rather than switched on.
//!
//! `tonic-health` works the same way — `tonic_health::server::health_reporter()`
//! hands back a service and a reporter, and the service goes to `add_service`.
//! # TLS
//!
//! [`GrpcAdapter::with_tls`] takes `tonic::transport::ServerTlsConfig` as it is.
//! Where certificates come from, how they rotate and whether client
//! certificates are demanded differ per deployment, so the configuration is
//! passed through rather than wrapped — mTLS is `ServerTlsConfig::client_ca_root`,
//! and the rest of the surface is tonic's.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let identity = Identity::from_pem(fs::read("server.pem")?, fs::read("server.key")?);
//! let adapter = ulo_grpc::GrpcAdapter::new(addr)
//!     .with_tls(ServerTlsConfig::new().identity(identity));
//! ```
//!
//! The acceptor is built during `app.bind()`, so an unreadable certificate
//! fails startup rather than the first connection.
//!
//! Enable `tls-ring` or `tls-aws-lc` — the same crypto-provider choice tonic
//! asks for, left where the deployment can make it. With both enabled tonic
//! resolves to ring.
//!
//! # Drain timeout
//!
//! On shutdown the framework calls the adapter's `close`, which signals
//! tonic and starts a drain timer (default 10 s). When the timer elapses with
//! calls still in flight, their replies are ended: each closes with
//! `UNAVAILABLE`, the connections have nothing left to serve, and tonic's
//! graceful shutdown closes them. A streaming handler's cancellation token
//! fires as its reply ends. Closing is bounded by the same timer, so `close()`
//! returns within twice the drain timeout. Configure with
//! [`GrpcAdapter::with_drain_timeout`]; pass `None` to wait without bound.
//!
//! # Tracing
//!
//! Every dispatched method runs inside a `tracing::info_span!("rpc.request",
//! transport = "grpc", pattern = …, peer = …)` span, so any event the user
//! handler emits inherits those fields without having to thread context
//! through.
//!
//! See the crate's [README](https://docs.rs/ulo-grpc) for the full enhancer
//! API (guards / interceptors / error handlers / panic recovery) and a
//! runnable end-to-end example.
