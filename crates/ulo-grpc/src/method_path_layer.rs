//! Puts the method path a call arrived on onto its request.
//!
//! `/package.Service/Method` exists on the wire and nowhere in the impl block
//! `#[grpc_methods]` reads: a trait's Rust name carries no package, and a
//! method's Rust name takes the route's casing by convention that
//! `tonic_build::manual` does not have to follow. tonic inserts its own
//! `GrpcMethod` extension on the client side only.
//!
//! Cheap by construction — the request is annotated and the inner future
//! returned as it is, so this adds no allocation per call.
